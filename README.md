GOAL
The goal of this week's Independent Project is to help us practice and better understand the concepts that we have covered throughout this week. These include working with data types, Array, writing functions, control flow, and operators.

Overall Description
For this week's Independent Project, you will be required to build a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name. 

USER STORY
 As a user, I would like to;

See a  small description of what the application does on the landing page.
Enter my birthday through a form 
Choose what gender I am.
Click the submit button to see what my Akan name would be
Requirements 
The application should check whether the date and month entered is valid. if either of them is invalid,  the user should be alerted and asked to enter a valid one. For example:
        An invalid day should be (d<=0) or (d>31)

        An invalid month should be (m<= 0) or (m > 12)  

The application should output to the user their Akan name depending on their gender. For example, if a user is male and the result of the calculation is 0, then the application should match that with Kwasi since Kwasi corresponds to Sunday which has an index 0. Hence the output the user will see should be something like “Your Akan name is Kwasi”
OBJECTIVES

The project will be evaluated based on the following objectives:

The project uses one or more javascript functions.
Appropriate control flows and logical operators are used in the project.
The project makes use of one or more arrays in javascript.
The project uses a  HTML input to collect user data.
The project uses a custom CSS stylesheet that incorporates cascading, box model and floats.
The project works as expected, achieving the functionality required.
The project demonstrates an understanding of the week's concepts. If requested, you should be able to explain your code to your instructor.
